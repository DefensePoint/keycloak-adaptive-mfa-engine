# --- IP intelligence data -----------------------------------------------------
#
# Built in its own stage so the databases land in the image while the tooling used
# to fetch and derive them does not.
#
# --keep-city retains DB-IP City Lite (~125 MB), which is the only source of true
# coordinates: without it every address in a country resolves to the same
# centroid, so impossible-travel sees zero distance for any move inside a country.
# The centroid table is generated regardless and remains the fallback for
# addresses the city database cannot place.
#
# To build a country-only image instead, override the arg and set GEOIP_CITY_PATH
# to empty at runtime:
#   docker build --build-arg IP_BUNDLE_ARGS=--with-city .
#
# This stage needs network access. Only the *runtime* is air-gapped: an isolated
# site consumes a pre-built image rather than building one in place.
