"""Setting up and tearing down an isolated environment for one matrix run.

Three jobs, in the order they matter.

**Preflight.** Refuse to run against a stack that cannot produce meaningful rows, and
say precisely what is wrong. Every check here corresponds to a way a run has already
been silently invalidated, so a clear failure now is cheaper than a confusing matrix
later.

**A throwaway realm.** Each run gets its own realm, cloned from the shipped
test-amfa export, and deletes it afterwards. Nothing the suite does touches a realm a
human is using. The alternative, mutating a shared realm and restoring it, was
rejected after a single admin PUT replaced the realm's attribute map rather than
merging it, removing `fallbackRisk` and breaking every login in that realm.

**Its own scoring parameters.** The suite writes the weights and allow/deny lists it
scores against, rather than inheriting them. This is not a preference. A realm with no
parameters falls back to `default`/`default`, and `DEFAULT_DECISION_PARAMS` ships with
all nineteen signals `disabled: True`, so an inherited configuration would produce a
matrix where no signal ever fires and every row reads the same. Owning the spec also
means the expected levels are determined by this file rather than by whatever someone
last edited in the database, which is what makes a recorded run replayable on another
machine.
