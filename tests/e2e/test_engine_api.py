"""The engine's public API: what it accepts, what it refuses, and how it fails.

The V family of tests/e2e/coverage-plan.md.

`/decision` is the endpoint that decides whether a user is challenged. Everything else
in the suite drives it through a login, which only ever sends well-formed requests from
a trusted caller. These go at it directly, because the interesting cases are the ones a
login cannot produce: a malformed body, a token from the wrong realm, a user with no
history, a request the engine accepts and then cannot store.

Two properties matter more than the status codes.

**Bad input must not become a risk decision.** A request the engine cannot understand
has to be refused, not scored, because a scored request returns a level and a level
decides whether someone is challenged.

**Failing should not mean failing open.** When the engine cannot complete an evaluation
it must fail, not fabricate a verdict: a request it accepts and then cannot store
comes back as an error, never as HTTP 200 with a riskLevel. Returning "the configured
fallback" instead of an error on such a failure -- treating the environment as
authoritative for that value -- would carry a real cost: a malformed field would be
enough to make a real Risk 4 (deny) verdict come back as Risk 1 (no challenge),
indistinguishable from a real decision to anything checking only the status code. See
`test_a_request_the_engine_cannot_store_fails_rather_than_fabricating_a_verdict`, which
is the reason this file exists.

Runs from the host against a live stack; needs only `requests`.

    This suite used to read the environment's `FALLBACK_RISK_LEVEL` and assert the

    That was a deliberate design decision, made after an earlier xfail argued a failed
    evaluation should not return the lowest risk. Testing exposed the actual cost
    of it: a malformed field made a real Risk 4 (deny) verdict come back as Risk 1 (no
    challenge) instead, because the exception handler converted every unhandled error

    The contract is now the opposite: a request the engine accepts but cannot store
    must come back as a server error, never as HTTP 200 with a riskLevel. Keycloak's
    SPI already treats any non-2xx response from this endpoint as a failure and
    applies its own separately configured fallback (`AdaptiveAuthService` throws on
    status >= 300), so this hands the failure to the layer that was always meant to
