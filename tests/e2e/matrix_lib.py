"""Driving real logins for the risk-signal matrix, and reading back the verdict.

The matrix needs one thing the rest of the e2e suite does not: the ability to log a
user in with a *chosen* context, repeatedly, and to recover the engine's own
explanation of the decision it made. That is what this module provides.

Two design notes worth stating, because both are load-bearing.

**The explanation is harvested, never authored.** Each row's "why" comes from the
engine's ``[RISK WHY]`` log line, matched on the user id. Writing those strings by
hand would mean the matrix documents a belief about the code rather than the code,
and would drift the first time a message changed. This only works because the line
is emitted as a single log record; a multi-line block cannot be scraped reliably.

**A row is only meaningful once the user is trained.** Below ``MIN_AUTH_EVENTS``
completed logins the engine short-circuits to a cautious level and every row reads
identically, whatever signals were sent. ``train()`` exists to get past that, and
``assert_trained()`` to fail loudly rather than silently produce a uniform matrix.

    Copies the completed logins and rewrites when they happened, one per day ending
    yesterday. Two details make this work where a naive copy does not.

    The rows are the ones real logins produced, so every context hash is whatever the
    factories actually compute. Nothing is synthesised and nothing can drift.

    The timestamp is rewritten *inside* ``auth_context_json``, not only in
    ``started_at``. ``df_user`` is assembled from that JSON, so its embedded
    ``event_time`` is the only clock the time-based signals ever see. Copying a row
    verbatim reproduces the original burst of logins in a single minute, which reads
    as an unusual hour and an irregular gap on every row.

    ``hour_shift`` moves the whole history by N hours, which is how the ``date_time``
    row makes the current hour look unusual without touching anything else.

    ``rows_to_copy`` copies only the oldest N logins, which is how the history-gate
    boundary is reached: the gate counts completed logins, so landing exactly on and
    one below ``MIN_AUTH_EVENTS`` needs control of how many exist.

    ``prior_decision`` rewrites what the copied logins were scored, and defaults to 1
    for a reason that is not obvious. The engine relaxes a clean login one step below
    the previous decision, so history recorded at Risk 3 makes a clean login come out
    at Risk 2. In the shipped realm Risk 2 demands TOTP while Risk 3 accepts an email
    code, so a user with an email address and no authenticator can complete a Risk 3
    login but not a Risk 2 one. Copying the training logins verbatim therefore produces
    a baseline that cannot log in at all. Recording the history as low risk is both the
    fix and an accurate description of the profile being modelled: a user whose recent
    logins were unremarkable.
