"""Cross-tenant isolation on the risk decision API.

`user_id` in the request body is not, by itself, a safe key for a user's
authentication history: the API must also check that the caller is entitled
to that user, and that the user belongs to the caller's own tenant, not just
that the token's realm matches a second body field, `realm_id`, which a
caller satisfies simply by declaring its own realm. Without that check, a
token accepted for realm A could probe realm B's computed risk for a guessed
user_id (an oracle) and write a fabricated device/network fingerprint into
that user's profile (poisoning). This test demonstrates both attacks against
a real second realm.

This provisions a genuine second, throwaway realm (via `MatrixRun`, the same
mechanism the rest of this suite uses for an isolated tenant) alongside the
shared `test-amfa` realm, and confirms a token from one can never read or
influence the other's history for the same guessed user_id -- checked both
through the API's own response and directly against the stored rows.

Runs from the host against a live stack; needs `requests` and Docker
(MatrixRun creates/destroys the throwaway realm via the Keycloak Admin API).
