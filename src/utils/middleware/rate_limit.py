# completion without interleaving any other command, so concurrent callers
# can never race the count-then-write the way separate SCAN/GET+SET calls
# could: a whole-second bucket checked via a separate scan-then-write would
# let any number of requests landing in the same second all observe the
# same pre-existing state and get allowed through.
#
# Using a sorted set keyed by request time, rather than one key per second,
# also makes the window genuinely sliding: the limit is enforced against
# any trailing window-length span, not against whole-second buckets a burst
# could straddle.
