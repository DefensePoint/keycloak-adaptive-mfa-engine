"""Log-Odds Bayesian risk scoring.

An alternative to the weight-based risk-level scoring. Instead of averaging per-parameter
partial risk levels, every signal contributes an *evidence* term (in log-odds space) that is
summed together with a calibratable *bias* and passed through a logistic function:

    P(fraud) = 1 / (1 + exp(-(evidence + bias)))

The resulting continuous probability in ``[0, 1]`` is then mapped to a discrete risk level
(1..4) via configurable thresholds.

Evidence convention (per signal, clamped to roughly [-2.5, +2.5]):
    * positive  -> risk signal   (a changed / anomalous parameter raises risk)
    * negative  -> trust signal  (a stable identity parameter lowers risk)

The bias term calibrates the model to a deployment's base fraud rate. Lower (more
negative) bias means the system is more trusting; higher bias means more suspicious.

    Industry (fraud rate)     Suggested bias
    Public Services (0.1%)    -6.9
    E-commerce (1-2%)         -4.6 .. -3.9
    Financial (2-5%)          -3.9 .. -2.9
    High-Security (10%)       -2.2

This module has no I/O and no framework dependencies: it consumes already-computed
signals and returns a decision, which keeps it trivial to unit test and reason about.
